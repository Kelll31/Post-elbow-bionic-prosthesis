# kelll31
In short, a new project of the bionic prosthesis of the post-elbow joint. At the moment, a model for printing is still being developed, so I have not yet posted it, but if someone wants to check it write here ---> https://community.alexgyver.ru/members/kelll31.2816/
I used 5x SG 90, 1 Arduino mega pro, EKG module on a chip AD8232, and some radio components from old pc.

I`m in history!
